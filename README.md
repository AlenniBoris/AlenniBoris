## 🚀 About Me

I am a student, 3rd year of BSU, FAMCS. For myself, not professionally, I am engaged in Greco-Roman wrestling, I used to swim, also not professionally. I have been traveling as a counselor to children's camps for the last two years, so I have patience and the ability to negotiate). Right now I'm searching for an internship or job to gain expirience in my sphere.
