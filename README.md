## 🚀 About Me

I am a student, 3rd year of BSU, FAMCS. For myself, I am engaged in wrestling and swim. For the last two years, so I aquired more patience and negotiation abilities, also became more disciplined and resistent to stress. Right now I'm searching for an internship or job to gain expirience in my sphere.
